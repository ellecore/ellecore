## Hi there 👋

I'm Helena, a cybersecurity student who's genuinely curiois about how systems work, how they fail and how to protect them.

I enjoy understanding how systems break, how to defend them, and how everything connects under the hood.

If an idea sounds useful (or chaotic in a good way), chances are I'll try to build it.

My main focus is cybersecurity fundamentals, security tooling, and exploring Digital Forensics. I'm especially interested in investigations, incident analysis, and how technical details turn into evidence.

## Fun facts
- I love learning languages
- Fashion and tech are a combo I actually enjoy
- I travel whenever I can
- I have a cat
- Hobbies: Reading, traveling, writing things at substack
